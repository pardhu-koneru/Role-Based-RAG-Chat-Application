However, we can infer some relevant data points that might be useful in estimating or calculating CPA.\n\nFrom the marketing reports, we can see that the company achieved:\n\n- 52,000 sign-ups for InstantPay through a multi-channel campaign (Q1 2024)\n- 40,000 new customer sign-ups through influencer partnerships in Southeast Asia (Q2 2024)\n- 10,000 sign-ups through a refer-a-friend program offering cashback rewards (Q1 2024)\n\nWe also know that the company spent a $2 million marketing budget in Q1 2024, which was strategically allocated to maximize ROI and align with customer acquisition and revenue goals.\n\nTo estimate CPA, we would need to know the total marketing spend and the number of conversions (acquisitions) achieved. However, the retrieved documents do not provide this information directly.\n\nIf we assume that the $2 million marketing budget was spent across all campaigns and channels, we can estimate the average cost per acquisition (CPA) for Q1 2024 as follows:\n\n- Total marketing spend: $2,000,000\n- Total acquisitions (sign-ups): 52,000 (InstantPay) + 40,000 (Southeast Asia) + 10,000 (refer-a-friend) = 102,000\n- Estimated CPA: $2,000,000 / 102,000 = approximately $19.61 per acquisition\n\nPlease note that this is a rough estimate and may not reflect the actual CPA, as the retrieved documents do not provide a clear breakdown of marketing spend by campaign or channel.",
